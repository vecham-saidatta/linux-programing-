LINUX-PROGRAMING
Activity 1

In this part, I played around with different ls command options (all the way from -b to -z).
I also tried some basic navigation commands like:

1)whoami (to see which user I’m logged in as)

2)pwd (to know my current working directory)

3)cd (to move around between directories)

On top of that, I experimented with the tree command and checked how it looks with different depth levels.

For each command, I made notes in the same format:

My remarks / what I understood

Activity 2

Here I went a bit deeper. I used more tree command options like:

1)-a (shows hidden files)

2)-d (shows only directories)

3)-u (displays the owner)

4)-p (shows permissions)

I also tried out a few networking commands such as:

1)ifconfig

2)ping

3)traceroute

4)nmap

And of course, I used mkdir to create directories while practicing.

Same style here too → command, description, output, and my remarks.

How I did everything

Opened my Linux terminal.

Typed the command and observed what happened.

Wrote down a short explanation of what the command does.

Copied the output I got.

Added my own remarks so it’s not just theory.

Finally, I uploaded all of it into two markdown files: Activity-1.md and Activity-2.md.
