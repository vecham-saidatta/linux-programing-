Activity 1

In this part, I played around with different ls command options (all the way from -b to -z).
I also tried some basic navigation commands like:

whoami (to see which user I’m logged in as)
pwd (to know my current working directory)
cd (to move around between directories)
On top of that, I experimented with the tree command and checked how it looks with different depth levels.
For each command, I made notes in the same format:
The command itself
A short description
Sample output I got on my machine
My remarks / what I understood

Activity 2

Here I went a bit deeper. I used more tree command options like:
-a (shows hidden files)
-d (shows only directories)
-u (displays the owner)
-p (shows permissions)
I also tried out a few networking commands such as:
ifconfig
ping
traceroute
nmap
And of course, I used mkdir to create directories while practicing.
Same style here too → command, description, output, and my remarks.
How I did everything
Opened my Linux terminal.
Typed the command and observed what happened.
Wrote down a short explanation of what the command does.
Copied the output I got.Added my own remarks so it’s not just theory.
Finally, I uploaded all of it into two markdown files: Activity-1.md and Activity-2.md.
